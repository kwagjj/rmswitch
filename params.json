{"name":"Rmswitch","tagline":"avr project for diy remote light switch using solenoid actuator.","body":"#what is this project?\r\nThis project aims to build a remote light switch using solenoid actuator functioned by cheap avr chips, battery, rf modules, etc. This switch is for rooms and users that have no intention to modify the power lines to control the light switch in a room. Instead, this device will mechanically move the switch in a room to turn on/off the light switch which is controlled by a remote control communicating through an rf module.\r\n\r\n#Bill of Materials\r\nSince this project targets to realize the goal with minimum budget, I have tried to use cheap components. This git will try to record all of my attempts to reach a cheaper, effective hardware setup so each version may implement different methods. Additionally, when this project matures to a point where the electrical/mechanical hardware seems to be cheap enough, I plan to spend some money to make a neat casing for the device.\r\nThe following materials are used at the start.\r\n- atmega328-16PU\r\n- \r\n\r\n- each version is saved in its own directory(e.g. v01, v02)\r\n- each version directory contains its own readme.md summarizing contents of each version.\r\n- not only codes, but also demonstration videos and images will be contained in each version directory.\r\n- Makefile\r\n  - used for linux environment. Should modify appropriately for other OS.\r\n  - need to manually change target-device parameters and usb bus location of avr programmer.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
