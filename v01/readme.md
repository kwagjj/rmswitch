v01 is prototype using atmega328-16pu chips on personal dev board. communication based on uart and directly connecting the uart communication to the RF433 tx/rx module. Unlike the tutorial that I referred to, my code doesn't implement addressing since there will be only one rx.

a video of demonstration should be uploaded soon.
